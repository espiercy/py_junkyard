#Very interesting to return to the first book that I used to start messing
#Around with programming. My initial roadblock, a good five years ago,
#Was chapter 6. After glancing at it, it isn't difficult to see why
#Ideas like scale, or even functions, make better sense when they are
#Expressed in Java. Python is good for a language that gets you up and moving
#In a given direction quickly, but there's nothing to it that really
#Stresses program control. I guess that's the nature of a scripting language.
