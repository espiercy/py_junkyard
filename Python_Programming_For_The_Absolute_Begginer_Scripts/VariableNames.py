#List of legal variable names
#I'll keep this list short, and it's Java I'm thinking of more than python
#But good java naming practices work well with python anyway

#var , able , var_able

#List of illegal variable names
#1 , and , elif , but

#Bad Legal Names:

# one //not descriptive
#VAR // it's good practice to reserve all caps for CONST

# x , y... These variables are good for short scripts, but if they need to be
# used frequently, it's time to find new names.
